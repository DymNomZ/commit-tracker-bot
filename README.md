A Discord bot that tracks the latest commit at this repo: https://github.com/DymNomZ/Java-2D-Game-Collab <br>
It checks the latest commit hash and stores it, the next time it checks and the hashes don't match, it notifies everyone in the Discord group.
It sends the following details: commit hash, commit message, author, and date. The bot also mentions the corresponding author in the group.

I may or may not expand the bot to have general functionality. The bot has been built for me and my friends to use in our Java game project.
The bot is made using **C++** with the help of the **D++/Dpp Discord Library**.
